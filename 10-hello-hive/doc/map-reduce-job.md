# Perform MapReduce on the Mock Log File

Amazon EMR provides a number of ways to write map and reduce procedures, including Hive, Streaming, Pig, or Custom JAR. Here you will start using Java to write a Custom JAR for the map and reduce procedures. Each of these EMR technology types can be used to analyze data as a computational step in the Amazon EMR Cluster. The set of steps run in Amazon EMR Cluster comprise a Job Flow for analyzing a data-set. Hive, Streaming, Pig, and Custom Jar are the Job Flow types that can be used as steps in an Amazon EMR cluster.
